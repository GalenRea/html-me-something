<body><p> Tell ya 'bout them sobbin' women
    who lived in the Roman days.
    It seems that they all went swimmin'
    while their men was off to graze.
    Well, a Roman troop was ridin' by
    And saw them in there "me oh my",
    So they took 'em all back home to dry,
    Least that's what Plutarch says.</p>

    <p>Oh yes!
        Them a woman was sobbin', sobbin', sobbin'
        Fit to be tied.
        Ev'ry muscle was throbbin', throbbin'
        From that riotous ride.
        Oh they cried and kissed and kissed and cried
        All over that Roman countryside
        So don't forget that when you're takin' a bride.
        Sobbin' fit to be tied
        From that riotous ride!</p>

        <p>They never did return their plunder
            The victor gets all the loot.
            They carried them home, by thunder,
            To rotundas small but cute.
            And you've never seen,
            So they tell me, 
            Such downright domesticity.
            With a Roman baby on each knee
            Named "Claudius" and "Brute."</p>
